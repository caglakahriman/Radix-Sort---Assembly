# Radix-Sort-Assembly
Sorting data on stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions

A program in C which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments. I used my ft_printf function instead of the built-in printf.

On this project I,
- handle [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms),
- handle the implementation of [Radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) Sort,
- handle swapping the first two item on a stack,
- handle rotating the stack
